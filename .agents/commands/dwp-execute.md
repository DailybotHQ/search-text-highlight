# Command: `dwp-execute`

Thin delegator to the installed [`deepworkplan-execute`](https://github.com/DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill) sub-skill.

## Invocation

| Host                    | Form                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Claude Code             | `/dwp-execute`               |
| Codex / Cursor / Gemini | `#dwp-execute`               |
| Plain text              | "execute the deep work plan" |

## What it does

Hands control to `deepworkplan-execute`. The sub-skill:

1. Locates the active plan under `.dwp/plans/`.
2. Runs each task sequentially.
3. Validates the gate after every task.
4. Updates the plan's progress markers so `/dwp-status` can report state without re-running anything.

## How the agent runs this

1. Read the installed skill at `~/.claude/skills/deepworkplan-execute/SKILL.md`.
2. Follow its steps exactly.
3. Treat the active plan as the source of truth — do not skip a task, do not reorder, do not silently broaden scope.
4. If a validation gate fails, stop and surface the failure (do not "fix" the gate).

If the skill is not installed, see [`/dwp-create`](dwp-create.md) for installation steps.

## Repo-specific gates that every plan should respect

Whenever a task touches the relevant area, the gate should include the matching repo command:

| Area touched                                        | Gate command                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/**`, `test/**`                                 | `npm run test`                                                                           |
| Public types in `src/lib/type.ts`                   | `npm run build:tsc` + `npm run test`                                                     |
| Build config (`webpack.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`) | `npm run build`                                                                          |
| Lint / Prettier configs                             | `npm run eslint:check && npm run prettier:check`                                         |
| Docs only                                           | Manual review against [`docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md) |
| Anything in `.github/workflows/`                    | Reproduce locally with the [`/ci-reproduce`](ci-reproduce.md) command before merge       |

## On interruption

If execution is interrupted (model timeout, network, manual abort), restart with [`/dwp-resume`](dwp-resume.md). It re-reads the plan, finds the first unfinished task, and continues — it does **not** redo completed work.
